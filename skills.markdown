I started writing code when I was 12 and my parents purchased an [Amstrad CPC6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC). How could anyone forget all those BASIC programs "copypasted" from magazines: `10 CLS` and all that :) But my first professional experience as a programmer came much later, already in my twenties, when I automated some daily processes in my job at that time using VBA and Microsoft Excel and happened to realize I could actually do that for a living. Anyway, time really flies and along all these years I've had the chance to work with many technologies and deliver good quality products for many clients. 

### Current stack

- Flutter and Dart to create cross-platform mobile applications.
- .NET and C# to create APIs and web applications (backend).
- TypeScript, jQuery and Bootstrap to create web applications (frontend).
- Postgres as default go-to choice for any application that needs a database.

### Used at some point in my career

- Python and Django to create web applications.
- Kotlin and Java to create Android native applications.
- Swift and good old Objective-C to create iOS native applications.
- PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL to create web applications.
- Visual Basic and Access to create Windows programs.
- VBA to create macros and programs for Microsoft Office.

### Used at university and/or in personal projects 

- R & Shiny to analyze biological data and create dashboards.
- Xamarin Forms and React Native to create cross-platform mobile applications.
- Scala when I took [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) course.

I have also earned some degrees in different disciplines. This has helped me to develop a broader knowledge and become a better software developer overall:

* Master's Degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (_expected 2021_).
* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (2012).
* Master's Degree in SAP Functional Consulting (2008).
* Bachelor's Degree in Business Science (2002).
