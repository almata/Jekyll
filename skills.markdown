I started writing code when I was 12 and my parents purchased an [Amstrad CPC6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC). How could anyone forget all those BASIC programs <i>copypasted</i> from magazines... `10 CLS` and all that :)

But my first professional experience as a programmer came much later, already in my twenties, when I found out I could automate many daily processes in my job at that time using Visual Basic for Applications... and after some time I just realized I could do that for a living.

Anyway, time really flies and along the last two decades I've had the chance to work with many technologies and deliver good quality products for many clients. 

### Current stack

- _.NET_ for backend development.
- _React_ and vanilla JavaScript for frontend development – <i>keeping an eye on Vue and Blazor.</i>
- _Flutter_ to create cross-platform mobile applications – <i>keeping an eye on MAUI.</i>
- _Postgres_ as default go-to choice for any application that needs a database.

- SQL language to query Access, MySQL, SQL Server and Postgres databases.
- Python and Django to create web applications.
- Kotlin and Java to create native Android applications.

### Used at university or in personal projects 

- R & Shiny to analyze biological data and create dashboards.
